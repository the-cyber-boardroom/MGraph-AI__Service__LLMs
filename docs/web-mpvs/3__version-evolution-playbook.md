# Version Evolution Playbook

## Starting with v0.1 (Core MVP)

### Purpose
v0.1 establishes the foundational architecture and core functionality. This version proves the concept and sets patterns for future iterations.

### v0.1 Checklist
- [ ] Basic project structure established
- [ ] Core components functional
- [ ] API integration working
- [ ] Essential UI/UX in place
- [ ] Event communication patterns defined
- [ ] Basic error handling

### v0.1 Anti-patterns to Avoid
- Over-architecting for future features
- Premature optimization
- Complex state management
- Feature creep beyond MVP
- Excessive configuration

### Example v0.1 Structure
```
v0.1/
├── index.html                    # Simple entry point
├── css/
│   ├── main.css                 # Core styles
│   └── components.css           # Component styles
└── js/
    ├── components/
    │   ├── main-component.js   # Primary component
    │   └── sub-component.js     # Supporting component
    └── utils/
        └── api-client.js        # API communication
```

## Incremental Feature Versions (v0.2-v0.5)

### Version Planning Matrix

| Version | Focus Area | Typical Additions | Success Criteria |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| v0.2 | UI Polish | Bug fixes, styling improvements, responsive design | Better UX, no functional regression |
| v0.3 | Data Enhancement | Caching, deduplication, data validation | Improved data quality |
| v0.4 | Monitoring | Logging, analytics, performance metrics | Visibility into system behavior |
| v0.5 | Advanced Features | Complex interactions, integrations | Feature completeness |

### Version Independence Rules

1. **No Shared Code**
   ```javascript
   // BAD - Creates dependency
   import { Component } from '../../v0.1/components/component.js';
   
   // GOOD - Copy and modify
   // Copy component.js to current version and modify
   ```

2. **Complete Functionality**
   - Each version must run standalone
   - No external version dependencies
   - Self-contained assets and styles

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   ```javascript
   // v0.2 enhances v0.1 pattern
   class EnhancedComponent extends HTMLElement {
       constructor() {
           super();
           // v0.1 functionality
           this.basicFeature = true;
           // v0.2 addition
           this.enhancedFeature = true;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Breaking Changes Allowed**
   - API changes between versions OK
   - UI restructuring permitted
   - State management can evolve

### Feature Migration Strategy

#### Evaluation Phase
```markdown
Feature Evaluation Checklist:
- [ ] Feature works reliably in current version
- [ ] No major bugs or edge cases
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Code is clean and maintainable
- [ ] Feature adds clear value
```

#### Migration Pattern
```javascript
// v0.3 feature to migrate
class LocalFeature extends HTMLElement {
    uniqueCapability() {
        // Proven functionality
    }
}

// v0.4 incorporation
class UpdatedComponent extends HTMLElement {
    constructor() {
        super();
        // Previous features preserved
        this.existingCapabilities();
        // New feature integrated
        this.uniqueCapability(); // Migrated from v0.3
    }
}
```

## Consolidation to v1.0

### When to Consolidate
- All planned features are proven
- No major architectural changes expected
- Performance meets requirements
- UI/UX is polished and consistent
- Testing reveals no blockers

### Consolidation Process

#### Step 1: Feature Inventory
```markdown
## Features to Consolidate
### From v0.1
- [x] Core text analysis
- [x] Basic UI structure
- [x] API integration

### From v0.2
- [x] Enhanced error handling
- [x] Improved styling
- [x] Character counter

### From v0.3
- [x] Global/local analysis views
- [x] Smart deduplication
- [x] Analysis tracking

### From v0.4
- [x] Activity logging
- [x] Analysis dashboard
- [x] Search functionality

### From v0.5
- [x] Cache integration
- [x] Request inspection
- [x] Performance metrics
```

#### Step 2: Architecture Refinement
```javascript
// Identify common patterns across versions
const patterns = {
    componentStructure: 'v0.5',  // Best implementation
    eventHandling: 'v0.3',        // Most robust
    apiClient: 'v0.4',            // Most complete
    stateManagement: 'v0.5'       // Most scalable
};
```

#### Step 3: Code Consolidation
```
v1.0/
├── components/           # Best of each component
│   ├── text-analyzer/   # Main orchestrator (v0.5)
│   ├── chat-panel/      # Enhanced from v0.5
│   ├── analysis-panel/  # Combined v0.3-v0.5
│   ├── activity-log/    # From v0.4-v0.5
│   └── llm-viewer/      # From v0.5
├── services/            # Consolidated services
├── utils/              # Merged utilities
└── css/               # Unified styles
```

#### Step 4: Integration Testing
```javascript
// v1.0 test checklist
const tests = {
    components: 'All render correctly',
    events: 'Communication works between all components',
    api: 'All endpoints functional',
    state: 'State management consistent',
    performance: 'No regressions from versions',
    features: 'All consolidated features work'
};
```

### v1.0 Quality Standards

#### Code Organization
```
Clear separation:
- Components: Self-contained with own CSS
- Services: Shared API and data logic
- Utils: Pure functions and helpers
- CSS: Global vars, component styles
```

#### Documentation
```javascript
/**
 * Component consolidated from v0.3-v0.5
 * Primary features:
 * - Feature A (from v0.3)
 * - Feature B (from v0.4)
 * - Feature C (from v0.5)
 */
class ConsolidatedComponent extends HTMLElement {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### Performance Benchmarks
- Initial load: < 2 seconds
- API response handling: < 100ms overhead
- DOM updates: < 16ms (60 fps)
- Memory usage: Stable over time

## Version Evolution Best Practices

### Do's
- ✓ Keep versions independent
- ✓ Document what each version adds
- ✓ Test with real API immediately
- ✓ Maintain consistent patterns
- ✓ Focus on one major feature per version

### Don'ts
- ✗ Share code between versions
- ✗ Refactor working features prematurely
- ✗ Add multiple major features per version
- ✗ Consolidate before features are proven
- ✗ Break core functionality when adding features

### Version Commit Messages
```bash
# Clear version indicators
git commit -m "v0.1: Initial MVP with core analysis"
git commit -m "v0.2: Add UI polish and error handling"
git commit -m "v0.3: Implement global/local analysis views"
git commit -m "v0.4: Add activity logging and dashboard"
git commit -m "v0.5: Integrate cache inspection"
git commit -m "v1.0: Consolidate all features to production"
```

## Rollback Strategy

### When to Rollback
- Critical bug in new version
- Performance regression
- Feature doesn't work as expected
- User experience degraded

### Rollback Process
```bash
# Versions are independent, so rollback is simple
cd project/
rm -rf current/
cp -r versions/v0.4/ current/  # Rollback to v0.4
# No dependency issues!
```

### Post-Rollback Actions
1. Document why rollback was needed
2. Fix issue in separate version
3. Re-test thoroughly
4. Re-attempt consolidation

## Evolution Timeline Example

```
Day 1 Morning:   v0.1 - Core MVP (2-3 hours)
Day 1 Afternoon: v0.2 - UI Polish (1-2 hours)
Day 2 Morning:   v0.3 - Enhanced Features (2-3 hours)
Day 2 Afternoon: v0.4 - Monitoring/Analytics (2 hours)
Day 3 Morning:   v0.5 - Advanced Features (2-3 hours)
Day 3 Afternoon: v1.0 - Consolidation (2-3 hours)
```

This timeline shows realistic progression with focused work sessions, allowing for testing and refinement between versions.
